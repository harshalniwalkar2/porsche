    History and Background
Porsche, formally known as Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, was founded in 1931 in Stuttgart, Germany, by Ferdinand Porsche, Anton Piëch, and Adolf Rosenberger. Initially, it focused on automotive consulting and vehicle development, famously designing the Volkswagen Beetle. The first Porsche-branded car, the 356, was launched in 1948 and paved the way for the iconic 911 in 1964, known for its air-cooled rear engine and six-cylinder "boxer" layout. Today, Porsche operates as part of the Volkswagen Group and maintains a reputation for combining luxury, performance, and engineering excellence.
